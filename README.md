# Calculator
 Students were tasked to create a fully functioning calculator that could operate basic multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction over floating point numbers. Calculator should allow users to also delete wrong numbers and clear as well as chain operations. Calculator has keyboard support with numbers and operations being their respective buttons and "esc" being clear and "backspace" being delete. Calculator rounds floating points to the fifth decimal.

 1. Use of javascript for logic of calculator to stop from any illegal orperations.
 2. Use of mobile first development for calculator to function on all devices.
 3. Use of keyboard and mouse support for more options and ease of use.
 4. Use of mathematical functions and event listeners.
 5. HTML and CSS for structuring of calculator.
 6. Use of Git for Version control.

What I learned:
1. How to use mobile first development to allow for usage of multiple devices on the same webpage.
2. Usage of multiple functions to mitigate errors and stop users from trying to break the calculator.
3. How to add keyboard support to my projects.
4. JS DOM Manipulation and use of HTML, CSS, and JS in one project together

What's Next:
1. Learning SASS and PostCSS
2. Learning advanced JS usage and syntax
3. ReactJS

Project led by The Odin Project.
